Notes:
- double quotes character on row 305/6 (it was a typo anyway)
- might need any boxes with just notes and no numbers in data columns to be gone
  (like AQ:282 "Site 2 too high...")
- changed 1.2m to 10NTU at G:284 and G:285
Using BindByName (old):
- to preserve column names, need to change the turbidity column names
  to distinguish between the two
- ideal to put space after degree symbol in column S
     or I could figure out regexes
- also ideal to change AQ column header
Using BindByPosition (new):
- remove headers altogether
