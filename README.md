# lwwip-stream-monitoring-data-project

As part of my 3rd year at the Lake Washington Watershed Internship Program, I have chosen to do a technical project, particularly analyzing (and perhaps visualizing) our stream monitoring data.

This project began in November 2018, and was added to GitHub in March 2019.
