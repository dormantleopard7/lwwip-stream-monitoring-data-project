Changes required to make file-reading work:
* change double quotes character at BT306 to colon (it was a typo anyway)
* change "Site 2" at AQ282 to "Site Two"
* change 1.2m to 10 NTU at G284 and G285
* date incorrect at A314 and A315
- remove headers (line 1) altogether, so that the first line now has data (use a text editor to do this)

* something that should be changed in the Google sheet
