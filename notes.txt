Changes required to make file-reading work:
* change double quotes character at BT306 to colon - it was a typo anyway, in general want fewer typos
* change "Site 2" at AQ282 to "Site Two" - in general do not want numbers if not intended to be data
* change 1.2m to 10 NTU at G284 and G285 - in general first turbidity column should be NTU and second in m
* date incorrect at A314 and A315 - should be 2019
- remove headers (line 1) altogether, so that the first line now has data (use a text editor to do this)

* something that should be changed in the Google sheet soon

How to run the program (on Windows):
- download Java
- download the .jar
- download the data and do the above
- move the file to the same directory as the .jar file
- open Command prompt (cmd.exe) or something similar (like git bash)
- navigate to the directory (using the cd command)
- when in directory, run java -jar lwwip-stream-monitoring-data-project.jar
- it should prompt for file name; enter the file name (including the .tsv)
- should be good to go!
