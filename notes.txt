Changes required to make file-reading work:
* change double quotes character at BT306 to colon - it was a typo anyway, in general want fewer typos
* change "Site 2" at AQ282 to "Site Two" - in general do not want numbers if not intended to be data
* change 1.2m to 10 NTU at G284 and G285 - in general first turbidity column should be NTU and second in m
* date incorrect at A314 and A315 - should be 2019
- remove headers (line 1) altogether, so that the first line now has data (use a text editor to do this)

* something that should be changed in the Google sheet soon
